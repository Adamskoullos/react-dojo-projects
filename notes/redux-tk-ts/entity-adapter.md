## createEntityAdapter

From `createEntityAdapter` we can create an `adapter` for a `slice`. This adapter does a few of things:

1. Allows us to create memoized selectors
2. Provides built in reducer methods to be used within the slice
3. Allows us to create a normalized initial state data structure and the methods maintain the data structure
